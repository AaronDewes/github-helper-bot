# Umbrel's GitHub bot (Version 2)

This is a GitHub bot for Umbrel, built using probot.
This is still in development (it hasn't been tested yet) and should not be used for your own projects.

[probot-unfurl](https://github.com/probot/unfurl/)
[mistaken-pull-closer](https://github.com/probot/mistaken-pull-closer)

... And, of course, every dependency in our dependency tree.

Thanks to everyone who created or helped creating these projects!
