# Umbrel's GitHub bot (Version 2)

This is a GitHub bot for Umbrel, built using probot.
This is still very much in development and should not be used.

## Sources

This bot wouldn't be possible without these amazing projects:

[Probot](https://github.com/probot)
[gh-polls-bot](https://github.com/evenchange4/gh-polls-bot) by [Micheal HSU](https://michaelhsu.tw/)
[probot-ooo](https://github.com/swinton/probot-ooo) by [Steve Winton](https://github.com/swinton)
[sentiment-bot](https://github.com/behaviorbot/sentiment-bot)

... And also, of course, every dependency in our dependency tree.


Thanks to everyone who created or helped creating these projects!
