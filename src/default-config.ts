    //    pull requests and isn't the kind of mistake this bot was intended to
    //    detect.
    // 3. User does not have push access to the project. They can't push to
    //    their own PR and it isn't going to be useful.

  Thanks for your submission.
  It appears that you've created a pull request using one of our repository's branches. Since this is
  almost always a mistake, we're going to go ahead and close this. If it was intentional, please
  let us know what you were intending and we can see about reopening it.
  Thanks again!
